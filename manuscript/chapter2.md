# App Development 101
Mobile Device, Operating System
The mobile device is the physical hardware, for example, iPhone 4, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4. On each hardware device runs an operating system. In general each phone only supports one variant of an operating system: iPhone use iOS, Samsung and others use Android. Users on both these platforms expect their apps to obey the “look and feel” of other apps on the phone. For example an iPhone app translated into an Android app without adjustment for the Android platform won’t be loved by its users.

The two dominant mobile platforms are currently Apple iOS and Google’s Android. Although there are some other mobile operating systems: Windows, Meego, etc, these are minor, and unless you are targeting a highly specific niche that tend to use an obscure OS, 

## Apple App Store

# Mobile App Checklist
When you have found, pitched, and secured your technical co-founder, and built your app, there are a few things you should “check off.” It’s well possible that your co-founder has forgotten about certain things.

 - Can your users provide prompt and timely feedback?

    - Use real time feedback tools such as Olark for your website, and Helpshift for your app.

 - Can your users socially validate your app?

    - Add Facebook like buttons, Tweet buttons, on your website.
    - Add Facebook page like links and Follow Twitter buttons in your app.
    - Feature a “Tell a Friend” link prominently in your app

**BroApp**

In the first version of BroApp we had a prominant “Share with a Friend” link on the main page after configuring the app. We were getting around 2-3% conversion; that is, out of every 100 people who configured the app, only 2-3 were then sharing it with a friend. In an updated release we changed this link to read “Tell a Friend” and prompt saw a 10x increase in sharing: around 25 in every 100 people would share our app with a friend on completion.

# What should I do in the meantime while my technical co-founder is programming?

 - Write, re-write, re-re-write your:
   - Press release;
   - FAQ;
   - About Me page;
   - App store description;
   - Privacy policy;
   - Terms and Conditions.

All my other founders have been non-technical and in every case we’re taken even splits of equity.
