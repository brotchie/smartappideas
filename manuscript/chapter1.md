# “I have don’t know anything about coding, but I want to build a mobile app.”

If you don’t have a large amount of capital to burn ($100k+) then most people see their only alternative as outsourcing to India / Phillipines / Vietnam, etc.

The primary problem with outsourcing is that they expect to be told EXACTLY what you want. Down to the “If I click this button, and the user then does this, the app should do this.” You generally need to precisely define every screen, every message, etc. And most of the time it will be “Yes sir, we can do that, Yes sir, we will do that” they will do everything you tell them. The thing is, **you don’t know what you really want!**

Software is an iterative design process. Current wisdom of software developer doesn’t treat software as a waterfall:

[water fall diagram]

Rather it’s a tight cycle, optimally a daily cycle, where new ideas are incorporate, added, tested, improved, or removed.

[lean cycle]

Part of this process requires a fundamental deep understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve (the problem domain) as well as deep technical knowledge of the capabilities of your target platform (iPhone, Android phones, etc). Without somebody with design authority and a solid connect to yourself in this tight loop, you’ll never create an app of sufficient quality and functionality.

## Why did I write this book?
I have developed a number of successful mobile apps and websites (Portal Charts, BroApp, MomApp, howfastisthenbn.com.au) and from within my social network im asked multiple times a week “I’ve seen your apps, I don’t know how to code, but I have an app idea, what should I do?” This is the distillation of my knowledge as a technical co-founder about the best approach to turning your idea into reality.

This book isn't for you if you:

 - are not willing to give away a substantial chunk of equity;
 - don’t have any skills or contribution to the company other than the idea;
 - not willing to learn skills that your technical co-founder doesn’t know: Facebook marketing, social media engagement, video production, etc.

## “My Idea isn’t worth much at all”
Stories of simultaneous discovery. What matters is the execution and not the idea. Don’t choose an idea that you don’t have an edge in.

As a rule of thumb your idea isn't unique. I can guarentee that somebody else around the world, in a flash of insight, has come up with an idea, if not identical, very close to what you have come up with. Many inventions and scientific discoveries seem to happen simultaneously. The current view is that a confluence of factors primes people to be thinking a certain way about certain things. With certainty if Eisenstein hadn't had the brilliant insight of relativity or Mark Zuckeberg never hacked together a PHP website we would still know about the general theory of relativity or be using Facebook only a few years or months after our timeline.

I have a number of stories of parallel invention: 


### QRSnap
I had the idea to print and hand out custom qr codes to people are my city. With a simple app, users could associate any picture they want to with a given qr code. I printed out a few sheets of them, and stuck some up. Each code was printed out in a variety of colors with sticker backing. I pitched the idea to a few people but didn't have time to pursue it.

A few months later I attended a young entrepreneurs meetup my university and started chatting to a few people there. After the session ended a guy showed me the startup he was working on: colored, laminated qr codes with embedded NFC chips to do very similar things to what I was proposing. What are the chances that two people in the same city, same university, same event, came up with very similar ideas... Coincidence?

## Every City in the Country
Unlikely, I bet in every city in every country around the world other people had the same idea, their attempts just hadn't been visible enough on the internet to.bubble into the mainstream tech coverage.

Talk to any entrepreneur and they'll tell you that they see this time and time again. Very very similar ideas discovered independently by geographically isolated groups or individuals.

Keywords: simultaneous discovery, technological inevitability.

## Which startups had technical co-founders?
Almost every successful startup has technical cofounder, be they designers or coders. There is always value in having non technical founder who have deep domain knowledge of the target field. Building solid, well engineered, product, however, requires substantial technical input.

# What motivates technical co-founders?
Working on interesting things.
Scope to impart their own style on the app.

Believe it or not most coders absolutely love programming, love being challenged with technical tasks, and love learning new technologies. 

Many coders working 9 to 5 jobs (or perhaps 8 to 6) don't particularly enjoy the day to day coding grind. They are often locked in to legacy technologies established at their work place, have to deal with office politics, get interrupted multiple times per day, and all the other burden that a beuracracy places on the individual.

Working on a brand new, green fiends pay project, without managment constraints can be enormously enjoyable for software developers. Nowhere there is one critical part.

As with everybody, software devleopers like to be valued. If they detect any hint that you take them for granted or that they are being exploited for their talents then their productivity will drop like a rock. Regardless of your opinion of the software trade, or yourself for that matter, reality is reality. And the objective fact is that you need to make the developer feel like their valued.

Hearing "we don't have money right now, but we'll give you some equity if what you do is good" will generally be met with, at least subconsciouslly, "fuck off."

## What can go wrong?
Often difficult to keep co-founders on task. Easily spent 10 hours working on making a nice animation for a button which otherwise may have been better spent to the login form.

## Where do I find technical co-founders?

 - Startup incubators.
 - Failed startups.
 - Pitch events.
 - University.

Outright advertise for co-founders on message boards, gumtree, etc. (But read the top 5 things you should know before hand).

## The top 5 things you should, and the top 5 things you shouldn’t ever say when courting a co-founder.

Think about onboarding a co-founder as pitching to venture capital for funding. They are potentially giving up a huge chunk of their time (time = money, especially given the employability of tech talent at the moment) for an uncertain gain. If you haven’t really thought through the idea, don’t expect them to be interested: do you have an idea about the size of the customer base, who your competitors are, what your edge is, etc.

 - NEVER ask them to sign an NDA, your idea simply isn’t that magical.
 - NEVER hint that you are low on capital so that you can’t pay them up front.

 - ALWAYS give them a substantial chunk of equity, perhaps get them to work for a while initially with an option to buy a huge chunk of equity for a nominal value.
 - ALWAYS talk with them as if it’s a collaboration.
 - ALWAYS bring something to the table yourself, are you excellent at sales, are you excellent at marketing. If you don’t bring anything to the table yourself, don’t expect a technical co-founder to be interested.
 - ALWAYS have some market validation of your product.

## How much equity should I give them?
A smaller slice of a bigger pie is always preferable to a larger slice of a minature pie.
People tend to act irrationally when it comes to distributing company equity. The originator of the idea tends to expect to maintain the vast majority of equity. The question you have to ask yourself, however, is "would I rather have the entirety of a small pie, or a small sliver of a big one"
Realistically without any expenditure on your part, your idea is going nowhere. The absolutely cheapest thing you have (pretty much worth zero at the moment) that I generally.misvalued by both yourself and the technical cofounder you wish to attract is equity. For a competent developer there is no way in hell, without a multi-100k bankroll, you could afford to pay them their market wage. However give th a slice of the pie and it established a relationship. Thij kof it this way: 100% to you, 0% to outsourced help
